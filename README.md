Python implementation of permutations is presented. 
Two classes are introduced: Perm for permutations, 
Group for permutation groups. 
The class Perm is based on Python dictionaries and utilize cycle notation. 
The methods of calculation for the perm order, parity, ranking and unranking 
are given. A random permutation generation is also shown. 
The class Group is very simple and it is also based on dictionaries. 
It is mainly the presentation of the permutation groups interface with 
methods for the group order, subgroups (normalizer, centralizer, center, 
stabilizer), orbits, and several tests.
